The devastating impacts of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the power of viral infection in susceptible hosts. As such, there is a growing importance and urgency to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection induced changes in host gene expression.
Empirical evidence has shown that Golden Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been proven to be a suitable host model to assess SARS-CoV-2 kinetics and as such was choosen as the live model for our study. The experiment design and details of sequencing can be found online along with the raw fastq sequencing data on the Gene Expression Omnibus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with the GEO accession number: GSE156005 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE156005).
